# School-District-Donor-Analysis
This repository will store code related to a statewide analysis that reviews campaign finance documents for school districts.

## Use Cases
The helper.py file is used to create a stratified-proportional sample group that is representative of school districts across Texas. School district size is based on the number of schools associated with each district.

When you run the helper.py program, you'll see a txt file that has the names of school districts that can be used as a representative sample group.
